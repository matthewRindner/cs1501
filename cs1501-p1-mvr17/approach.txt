I use a DLB instead of an R-way trie many many reasons  There is significant memory overhead in a R-way trie since all the possible ascii characters. Also the speed of a DLB is much better then an R-way trie which has an O(wrn) which is the length of the longest key * the dictionary of ascii characters * n from the arrays. However this is the case for psered in data, such as our user prediction.
